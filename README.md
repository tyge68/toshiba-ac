# The project
Porting Toshiba AC (originally written in Golang) to Python to be use with [TinyTuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya)

# Motivation
While trying TinyTuya to control my Toshiba ACs, I found this awesome tool '[toshiba-ac](https://github.com/k3a/toshiba-ac)' written in Golang 
So porting the logic to python code so it could be easily integrated with TinyTuya / LocalTuya / Home Assistant is the main motivation.

# Status
Work in progress
